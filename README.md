# MLOps POC Repository

This repository contains all the Proof of Concepts (POCs) I work on as part of my learning journey in MLOps, following the **MLOps course by Krish Naik on Udemy**.

Each project or experiment in this repo is aimed at understanding different aspects of MLOps, including but not limited to:

- Model building and packaging
- Model deployment
- CI/CD for machine learning
- Monitoring and maintenance of ML systems
- Cloud integration (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Automation tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, etc.)

## Structure

- Each folder represents a different POC or topic.
- README files inside subfolders will explain each individual project wherever necessary.

## Disclaimer

This is a learning repository. The code and approaches used here are primarily for educational and practice purposes.
